# Generating Weather Comments from Meteorological Simulations

## Dataset
We will make weather comments publicly available and provide links to the numerical forecast maps and observation data for further research on this topic.
See our paper for more information.

### Weather comments
:construction: We are preparing to release the weather comments, provided by [Weathernews Inc](https://global.weathernews.com/). (April. 2021)

### Numerical forecast maps
We used numerical forecast maps as meteorological simulations around Japan simulated using the global spectral model (GSM), which is an NWP model, provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency.  
:dvd: The numerical forecast maps are publicly available [here](http://database.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/arch/jmadata/gpv-original.html) (in Japanese).  
**â€»Note**: These data were collected and distributed by [Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University](http://database.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index-e.html). 


### Meteorological observation data
We used meteorological observation data provided by the [AMeDAS]( http://www.jma.go.jp/en/amedas/), managed by [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html). Specifically, we use four physical quantities: precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, and sunshine duration. These quantities are sequential data observed every ten minutes at about 1300 stations across Japan.  
:dvd: The meteorological observation data are publicly available [here](https://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/risk/obsdl/) as a csv file (in Japanese).
